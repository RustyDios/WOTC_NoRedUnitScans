[h1] What is it? [/h1]
A simple config edit mod with some provided materials, that changes how scanned units look.
It makes units that have been scanned look like the mimic beacon holograms.

[h1] That's all ... seems lacking? [/h1]
It is lacking.

The original 'solid red' look has bugged me forever.
I originally intended to make Scanning Protocol and Battlescanners behave like Reaper Target Definition.
So that units in the FOW/Obscured would have the x-ray material and units in sight would not.
Alas this was out of my level of coding experience and I couldn't figure it out :(
Most of the code for outlining is all 'native' and hidden away, and every approach I tried met with either failure or crashes.

However the new material works like a charm.

[h1] Issues and Conflicts [/h1]
A unit that has been scanned will remain looking like a hologram untill the effect runs out. This is actually an issue with the base game. 
But hey, holograms look cooler than solid red flickering walls for that turn right?

Mod has no code, no overrides. Literally a config edit and some materials.
It shouldn't conflict with anything. Should work mid-campaign, strategy save. I wouldn't suggest a tactical one though.
Will likely work with LWOTC.
Doesn't effect the HIVE chameleons invisibility, as I don't change ANY mechanics.

[h1] Config ? [/h1]
Options are in XcomGameCore.ini

 Blue for scanned, yellow for target defined
 ... the mod has a red, green and purple holoscan material too, but I had no place to use them

[h1] Credits and Thanks [/h1]
As always many thanks to the great folks of the Xcom2 modders discord!

Maybe I can come back to this later and fix that scanning material issue whilst seen...
I know this mod isn't much, but figured other people might like the change :)
